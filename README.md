#MY NOTES

## React

### `class` based component vs. `function` based components

* `class` should be used whenever there is a concept of `state` in the component
*  `functional` components should be used whenever there is a simple component with a number of static properties and is just returning them

### `state`

State is local to COMPONENT - each component has it's own state

Redux has a "higher level" of state - Application

### `import` and `export` statements

### Callbacks

Great way to do parent/child communication without a lot of overhead
