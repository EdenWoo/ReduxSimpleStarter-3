# REDUX

### What is it?

#### Homepage:
* Predictable state container for JS applications...?

#### Plain English:
* All application's **DATA** is centralized inside a single object (where other tools use collections of object)
* This single object is the "Application State"

*NOTE: Find out what the pros and cons of a single application state is*

#### Reducer

Reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state.

```javascript
// Application State - Generated by Reducers
{
  books: [{ title: 'Harry Potter'}, {title: 'JavaScript'}], // Books Reducer
  activeBook: {title: 'Javascript: The Good Parts'} // ActiveBook Reducer
}
```

#### Container (Component)

Container is a React Component that has a direct connection to the state managed by Redux

Forms the bridge between React (View) and Redux (State, Data)

"Smart Component"

How do we determine whether or not the module should be a **COMPONENT** or **CONTAINER**

```javascript

```

#### `react-redux`

Allows for mapping between Redux and React

#### Flow of Application

1. User clicks a button (Book)
2. That in turn calls an **ACTION CREATOR** (function)
3. The action creator returns an object that is the **ACTION**
4. Action is sent to all the **REDUCERS**
5. Depending on what the action is - reducers can choose to return a different piece of state depending on the action
6. That new piece of state gets updated on the overall Application State
7. New State then notifies the **CONTAINERS** (components) of the changes to state and re-render the new props
